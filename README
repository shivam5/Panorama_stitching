===========================

Abstract
---------
The task was to create a panorama stitching for two images. The
program takes in 2 input images and lets the user select 4 points in both
the images. Then the homography matrix for the projective transformation was computed, 
and one image was warped using the computer projective transformation. Then using the warped 
image, we stitched both images to get a mosaic.

Please read the report for more details.


Running
--------
Open matlab, read 2 images in the command window by using imread.
Then call the computehomography function.

image1 = imread('Image1.JPG');
image2 = imread('Image2.JPG');
ComputeHomography_2015CSB1032(image1, image2);

The warped image and the stitched image would be saved in the folder.
